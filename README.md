## Overall Summary

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a serious condition that impacts many individuals. The data in this study was collected as a cross-sectional observational study, from patients in two age ranges (40-70, 75+) at a clinic in Philadelphia. Patients with a specific history were excluded from the study to mitigate confounding variables. There was a substantial amount of missing data in the study leading us to draw conclusions on incomplete data. Some trends I found within the data was there was much large proportion of females to males within the study as well as a large amount of patients who did not have their disease severity score measured compared to those who did have their disease score measured. However, there were weak associations between if DAS_28 was measured compared to the years since diagnosis and if biologics were used. Overall, when interpreting the results, I would warn my audience to consider the vast amount of missing data and how it could potentially lead to bias making the results from our data unable to be generalized to the general population of RA patients.
